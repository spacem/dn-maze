> A DragonNest Skill Simulator

This project has been officially dropped as of 3/3/2018. There are no plans of continuing its development, or even rewriting it. Dragon Nest was initially fun but after 3 years I can't even get myself to play it again. This project requires me to have knowledge of the game, and I just don't have it anymore (or even care about it). I would not do this project any justice by continuing its efforts. There are alternatives to this (such as spacem, for however long s/he continues it, and the offiical simulator) that get more TLC than I provide, and I would definitely recommend you go to those instead if you are enjoying yourself with the game.

Until next time!
